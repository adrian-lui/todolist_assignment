# Design and color
This todo list web app is designed in a minimalist way. Only essential buttons (imo) are added for a simple user interface.
- This web app is responsive to computer or phone users (except phone user cannot drag the row of todos yet)
- The main color used is #00b6ba which I assume is the company color of Crosskey. The complementary colors are generated from the Adobe Color analyzer tool.

# Technology
This todo list app is written in pure JS, HTML and CSS. It is usable and responsive at latest version of Chrome and Safari.
