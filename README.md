# Todo List assignment
This repo is created for submitting the todo list assignment for Crosskey Frontend Summer Trainee position.
Go to the following link for preview:

# Usage
This todo list web app is designed in a minimalist way. Only essential buttons (imo) are added for a simple user interface.
- Type in your todos, add a (optional) date, and click Add or press Enter to add a todo to the list
- Type hashtags in the input and they will be automatically filtered out for categorization
- Click on the hashtags anchors under the input to filter out the todos with the same hashtags
- Click ✓ when a todo is done so it will be archived and ✗ for deleting completely
- For navbar, click on TODOS to refresh the list, Urgent to sort the list by time in ascending order, Archived for todos that are done (✓)
- Click on Export to export the todo list to a .ics file for importing to iCalendar or Google Calender
- Drag the row of todos to reorder them

# Design and color
- This web app is responsive to computer or phone users (except phone user cannot drag the row of todos yet)
- The main color used is #00b6ba which I assume is the company color of Crosskey. The complementary colors are generated from the Adobe Color analyzer tool.
